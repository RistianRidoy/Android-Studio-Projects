# TownTrek--Local-Tourist-Guide-Android-App
TownTrek-- This Android Studio Java-based local tourist guide app integrates Firebase for user authentication, Google Maps Platform APIs (Places and Directions) for location-based services, a custom dataset for tourist spots, OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather forecasting, and a CSV file for additional tourist spot details. UI design is implemented in XML, and technologies such as Volley and Retrofit handle robust networking and API communication. The app enables users to log in, sign up, explore nearby places, get directions, access weather forecasts, and discover tourist spots. Future enhancements could focus on societal welfare by incorporating community-driven features and promoting local economies through tourism improvements.
